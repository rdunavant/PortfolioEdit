Week 7 Reflection

	I just completed my seventh week of my code school journey and I feel proud

that I have made it this far. I have begun to prove to myself that I have the skill of

perseverance. I am especially proud that I have the option of dropping out whenever

I choose but have chosen to stay in the class. I find the material we go over in class

to be complex yet I have chosen to stay until four o’ clock every day. I do find my

mind shutting off after a large amount of information has been presented to me. I

believe it’s how I cope with being overwhelmed. I don’t plan on dropping out of the

class. What I actually like most about the class is the people, both my classmates and

instructors. The instructors are helpful and dedicating to helping when coding

becomes complicated. I am going to have a positive mindset about week 8 and will

try even harder than I did this past week and the week before that.
