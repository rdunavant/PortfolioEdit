        <p>My hobbies are comedy (recording myself pretending to be on stage), pranks, listening to music and the police scanner, and running.</p></div>

        <p>I love junk food. Every now and then, I like to reminisce about my past and plan new memories.</p></div>

        <p>My favorite places to vacation are Seaside, Florida and my grandmother's house on 400 acres of countryside.</p></div>
