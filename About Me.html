        <p>I am a 28-year-old lifelong resident of Memphis, Tennessee. The cities I can see myself living in are Tallahassee, Birmingham, and Jackson, Mississippi.</p></div>
    <div class="border">
        <p>I am employed with a local forprofit organization called Give Good that finds employment for local people on the autism spectrum. We have partnered with local candy companies, such as Dinstuhl's, who made products, such as toffee. We have sold them at several locations around town. </p>

    <div class="border">
        <p>My interests include dogs, nature, cities and countries, houses, news, the paranormal, and people.</p></div>

    <div class="border">
        <p>My hobbies are comedy (recording myself pretending to be on stage), pranks, listening to music and the police scanner, and running.</p></div>

    <div class="border">
        <p>I love junk food. Every now and then, I like to reminisce about my past and plan new memories.</p></div>

    <div class="border">
        <p>My favorite places to vacation are Seaside, Florida and my grandmother's house on 400 acres of countryside.</p></div>

    <div class="border">
        <p>I would make a good fullstack developer, because of my detail-oriented and organized way of thinking. I think in a step-by-step way and I like to consider all possibilities. I believe this is what it takes to become a good programmer.</p></div>

    <div class="border">
        <p>In addition to becoming a software developer, I want to work at a state or national park or forest. I want to study wildlife biology for a second career if I have time. Otherwise, it will be a hobby.</p></div>
    <div class="border">
        <p>If I could work at any state or national park or forest I wanted, it would either be Everglades National Park or Homochitto National Forest. I like the ecosystems of both and know the wildlife there.</p></div>
