Week 8 Reflection

	I just completed my eighth week of my code school journey and I am feeling

even prouder than last week. I have made it through one more week of something

new without problems. I am not extremely confident I will be invited to continue the

second half of the semester. If I do not, I would love to take the class next semester. I

have been thinking that I might need an extra six months of training. This is alright

with me and I have already decided to help my dad out at his office if I don’t receive

an invitation. I would still prefer to be invited back to continue through the rest of

the semester. If I do that, I still might need an extra six months. My biggest concern

about not being invited to continue this semester would be not seeing the friends I

have just made in class. I have already made connections with these people and I am

afraid they would be lost if I am not invited back. I also don’t feel strong about the

test I just took but with enough assistance from R.J. and P.J., I feel all of this could

change.
